CloudLoop Browser is a collaborative web interface for curating and publishing audio loops, sample packs, and whole albums.

For this hackathon we connected our audio metadata backend with a browser interface. Changes to playlists are broadcast via websockets to all connected clients, enabling a remote-collaborative curation and listening process.

We now support playlists of non-looping content, allowing creators to publish their own curated collections of high quality samples.

Producers can instantly share project files between ANY audio workstation, enabling new cross platform collaboration not available on existing systems.

check out sessions "house", "video8", "jeffandliam2", "turbo ratchet" for examples of what is possible. https://maari.hns.siasky.net/#/session/turbo%20ratchet
