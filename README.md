CloudLoop Browser is a collaborative web interface for curating and publishing audio loops, sample packs, and whole albums.

For this hackathon we connected our audio metadata backend with a browser interface.

We now support playlists of non-looping content, allowing creators to publish their own curated collections of high quality samples.

Thousands of users can tune in to a live looping session in real time

Producers can instantly share project files between ANY audio workstation, enabling new cross platform collaboration not available on existing systems.
